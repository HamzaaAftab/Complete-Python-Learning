## 📚 Python Variables
Variables are used to store data in Python. Unlike some other languages, Python allows dynamic typing, meaning you don't need to declare a variable's type explicitly.

### 🔹 Declaring Variables
To create a variable, simply assign a value using the `=` operator:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
pi = 3.14159
```

### 🔹 Variable Naming Rules
- Must start with a letter or underscore `_` (not a number)
- Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
- Case-sensitive (`age` and `Age` are different variables)
- Cannot use Python keywords (e.g., `class`, `def`, `for`)

### 🔹 Multiple Assignments
Python allows multiple variables to be assigned at once:

```python
x, y, z = 10, 20, 30
name1 = name2 = name3 = "Python"
```

## 🔢 Python Data Types
Python supports various built-in data types:

### 🔹 Numeric Types
Used for representing numbers:

```python
integer_num = 42  # int
float_num = 3.14   # float
complex_num = 2 + 3j  # complex
```

### 🔹 Text Type
Used for representing text:

```python
text = "Hello, Python!"  # str
```

### 🔹 Boolean Type
Used for representing `True` or `False`:

```python
is_python_fun = True  # bool
```

### 🔹 Sequence Types
Used for storing multiple items:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]       # list
my_tuple = (4, 5, 6)     # tuple
my_range = range(10)     # range
```

### 🔹 Set Type
Used for storing unique elements:

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 3}  # {1, 2, 3}
```

### 🔹 Mapping Type
Used for key-value pairs:

```python
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}  # dict
```

## 🔄 Type Conversion
You can convert between data types using built-in functions:

```python
x = 10   # int
y = float(x)  # Converts to float
z = str(x)    # Converts to string
```

## 🎯 Conclusion
Understanding **variables and data types** is crucial for mastering Python. With this knowledge, you can handle different kinds of data efficiently in your programs. Keep learning and coding! 🚀🔥
