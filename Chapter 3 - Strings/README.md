## 📜 Introduction to Strings
Strings in Python are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes. They are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation.

```python
string1 = "Hello, Python!"
string2 = 'Python is fun!'
string3 = """This is a multi-line string."""
```

---

## ✏️ Creating Strings
Python allows string creation using:
- Single quotes `'text'`
- Double quotes `"text"`
- Triple quotes `'''text'''` or `"""text"""` (for multi-line strings)

```python
single = 'Hello'
double = "World"
multi_line = '''This is a multi-line string.'''
```

---

## 🔍 String Indexing & Slicing
### 🔹 Indexing
Each character in a string has an index:

```python
text = "Python"
print(text[0])  # P (first character)
print(text[-1]) # n (last character)
```

### 🔹 Slicing
Extracting substrings using slicing:

```python
text = "Hello, Python!"
print(text[0:5])  # 'Hello'
print(text[:5])   # 'Hello'
print(text[7:])   # 'Python!'
print(text[-7:])  # 'Python!'
```

---

## 🛠️ String Methods
Python provides several built-in string methods:

```python
text = " python programming "
print(text.upper())       # ' PYTHON PROGRAMMING '
print(text.lower())       # ' python programming '
print(text.strip())       # 'python programming' (removes spaces)
print(text.replace("python", "Java"))  # ' Java programming '
print(text.split())       # ['python', 'programming']
```

---

## 📝 String Formatting
Python provides multiple ways to format strings:

### 🔹 Using `format()`
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print("My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age))
```

### 🔹 Using f-strings (Python 3.6+)
```python
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```

---

## 🎭 Escape Characters
Escape characters allow special formatting in strings:

```python
print("Hello\nWorld")  # New line
print("She said, \"Python is amazing!\"")  # Double quotes inside string
```

---

## 🛡️ Raw Strings
Raw strings treat backslashes (`\`) as normal characters:

```python
print(r"C:\Users\Alice\Documents")
```

---

## 🎯 Conclusion
Strings are fundamental in Python, used in almost every program. Mastering string operations and methods will enhance your coding skills. Keep practicing and happy coding! 🚀🔥
