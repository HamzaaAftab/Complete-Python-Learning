# Sets is a collection of non-repetive elements
# Dictionaries and set are defined in a same way using {}, but dictionary consists of key value pairs and set does not have,

# s = {1,5,32}
# In order to create empty set
# e = set()
# if you declare {}, this is empty dictionary..

s = {1,5,32}
e = set()
print(type(s))
print(type(e))

# In sets, elements cannot be repeated, that's the main point..
