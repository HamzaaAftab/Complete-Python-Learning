## 📚 Python Modules
Modules in Python are files that contain reusable code such as functions, classes, and variables. They help in structuring programs efficiently.

### 🔹 Built-in Modules
Python provides numerous built-in modules. Here are some common ones:

```python
import math
print(math.sqrt(25))  # Output: 5.0

import random
print(random.randint(1, 10))  # Output: Random number between 1 and 10
```

### 🔹 Creating Custom Modules
You can create your own module by writing Python functions in a `.py` file. Example:

```python
# mymodule.py

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

Now, you can import this module into another script:

```python
import mymodule
print(mymodule.greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

### 🔹 Importing Modules
There are different ways to import modules:

```python
import mymodule  # Import entire module
from mymodule import greet  # Import specific function
import mymodule as mm  # Import with alias
```

## 📝 Python Comments
Comments help explain code and improve readability. Python ignores comments during execution.

### 🔹 Single-line Comments
Single-line comments start with `#`:

```python
# This is a single-line comment
x = 5  # Assigning 5 to x
```

### 🔹 Multi-line Comments
Python does not have a dedicated multi-line comment syntax, but triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`) can be used:

```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It spans multiple lines.
"""
```

## 🔗 Python PIP (Package Installer)
PIP is Python’s package manager used to install external libraries.

### 🔹 Installing Packages
To install a package, use:

```sh
pip install requests
```

### 🔹 Checking Installed Packages
To list installed packages:

```sh
pip list
```

### 🔹 Uninstalling Packages
To remove a package:

```sh
pip uninstall requests
```
