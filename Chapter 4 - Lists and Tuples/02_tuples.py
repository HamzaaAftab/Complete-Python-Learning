#They are defined by enclosing elements in parentheses ().
#Tuples are immutable, while lists are immutable..
# Tuples are collection like lists but they are just immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation

# Creating a tuple

tuple1= (1,2,6,5,8)
print(type(tuple1))

#creating empty tuple
a=()
print(a)

#creating tuple with only one element, for that you need to use ','
